# Ultrarunning
I love running and wondered how people who do it for long distances can do that! I looked at the various factors that determine a runner's speed and fit a random forest model to predict speed.

# Gender plays a part...
An ultramarathon is technically any race longer than a typical marathon (26.2 miles), but most tend to be 50 - 100 miles long. As it turns out, speed varies a lot depending on a person's age and gender. Men tend to get a lot slower, faster, and then have a rebound after age 60. Women are much more consistent, with a smaller decrease in speed over time and ages 25 - 65 having faster speeds than men!
